## The OpenShift environment


![OCP Architecture]({% image_path common-environment-ocp-architecture.png %})

You will be interacting with an OpenShift environment that is running on
a public cloud. You can log into the console at:

   
   [{{OPENSHIFT_MASTER_URL}}]({{OPENSHIFT_MASTER_URL}})
   

Additionally, a predefined number of user accounts have been
provisioned.

Decide on a user account among one of the available users or use the one
that has been assigned to you by the instructor. 

You will see various code and command blocks throughout these exercises.
Some of the command blocks can be copy/pasted directly. Others will
require modification of the command before execution. Typically this is a 
substitution of your username or user number:

~~~shell
some command for {{ OPENSHIFT_USERNAME }}
~~~
    
# Command Line

The first thing we want to do to ensure that our `oc` command line tools
was installed and successfully added to our path is to log in to the
OpenShift environment that has been provided for this Workshop session.

In order to log in, we will use the `oc` command and then specify the
server that we want to authenticate to. Issue the following command:

~~~shell
oc login {{CONSOLE_ADDRESS}}
~~~

You may see the following output:

~~~shell
The server uses a certificate signed by an unknown authority.
You can bypass the certificate check, but any data you send to the server could be intercepted by others.
Use insecure connections? (y/n):
~~~

Enter in **Y** to use a potentially insecure connection. The reason you
received this message is because we are using a self-signed certificate
for this workshop, but we did not provide you with the CA certificate
that was generated by OpenShift. In a real-world scenario, either
OpenShift’s certificate would be signed by a standard CA (eg: Thawte,
Verisign, StartSSL, etc.) or signed by a corporate-standard CA that you
already have installed on your system.

> **Note**
> 
> On some versions of Microsoft Windows, you may get an error that the
> server has an invalid x.509 certificate. If you receive this error,
> enter in the following command:
> 
> ~~~shell
> oc login {{CONSOLE_ADDRESS}} --insecure-skip-tls-verify=true
> ~~~

Once you issue the `oc login` command, you will be prompted for the
username and password combination for your user account. Use the
username and password combination provided to you by the instructor of
this workshop:

~~~shell
Username: {{ OPENSHIFT_USERNAME }}
Password: {{ OPENSHIFT_PASSWORD}}
~~~

Once you have authenticated to the OpenShift server, you will see the
following confirmation message:

    Login successful.
    Using project "{{ USER_PROJECT }}".

> **Tip**
> 
> If you don’t have any projects. You can try to create a new project,
> by running:
> 
>     oc new-project <projectname>

Congratulations, you are now authenticated to the OpenShift server. The
OpenShift master includes a built-in OAuth server. Developers and
administrators obtain OAuth access tokens to authenticate themselves to
the API. By default your authorization token will last for 24 hours.
There is more information about the login command and its configuration
in the [OpenShift Documentation](https://{{DOCS_URL}}/cli_reference/get_started_cli.html#basic-setup-and-login).

# Using a Project

Projects are a top level concept to help you organize your deployments.
An OpenShift project allows a community of users (or a user) to organize
and manage their content in isolation from other communities. Each
project has its own resources, policies (who can or cannot perform
actions), and constraints (quotas and limits on resources, etc).
Projects act as a "wrapper" around all the application services and
endpoints you (or your teams) are using for your work.

During this lab, we are going to use a few different commands to make
sure that things in the environment are working as expected. Don’t worry
if you don’t understand all of the terminology as we will cover it in
detail in later labs.

If you didn’t have a project already created for you, the first thing we
want to do is create the **{{ USER_PROJECT }}** project. You can do
this with the following command:

> **Caution**
> 
> In the following command, replace `{{ USER_PROJECT }}` with the
> project provided to you.

~~~shell
oc new-project {{ USER_PROJECT }}
~~~

You will see the following confirmation message:

~~~shell
Now using project "{{ USER_PROJECT }}" on server "{{CONSOLE_ADDRESS}}".
~~~

If you had multiple projects, the first thing you would want to do is to
switch to the **{{ USER\_PROJECT }}** project to make sure you’re on the
correct project from now on. You can do this with the following command:

> **Caution**
> 
> In the following command, replace `{{ USER_PROJECT }}` with the
> project provided to you.

~~~shell
oc project {{ USER_PROJECT }}
~~~

You will see the following confirmation message:

~~~shell
Now using project "{{ USER_PROJECT }}" on server "{{CONSOLE_ADDRESS}}".
~~~

# The Web Console

OpenShift ships with a web-based console that will allow users to
perform various tasks via a browser. To get a feel for how the web
console works, open your browser and go to the following URL:

**[{{CONSOLE_ADDRESS}}]({{CONSOLE_ADDRESS}})**

The first screen you will see is the authentication screen. You will be
prompted for the username and password combination for your user
account. Use the username and password combination provided to you by
the instructor of this workshop:

~~~shell
Username: {{ OPENSHIFT_USERNAME }}
Password: {{ OPENSHIFT_PASSWORD }}
~~~

![OpenShift Login Screen]({% image_path ocp-login.png %})

After you have authenticated to the web console, you will be presented
with a list of items that you can add to your project. This is called
the service catalog. You will see something that looks like the
following image:

![Web Console]({% image_path explore-webconsole1sc.png %})

Click on the **{{ USER_PROJECT }}** project on the right hand side of
the screen. When you click on the **{{ USER_PROJECT }}** project, you
will be taken to the project overview page which will list all of the
routes, services, deployments, and pods that you have running as part of
your project. There’s nothing there now, but that’s about to change.
